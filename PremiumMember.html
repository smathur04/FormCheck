        <h3>Important Diet Tips (Specialized/Custom Plans Coming Soon): Always eat at least 0.8 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight. To gain muscle and strenth optimally you must be in a small calorie surplus, if you are eating at maintenance or at a defecit, muscle and strength gains are harder to achieve. Always track your calories and weight, but do not obsess about them. </h3>

The ideal depth to squat is when the crease of your hip joint is parallel or slightly below the top of your knee joint. Squatting to correct depth will optimize muscle growth, strength gains, and safety when squatting. Additionally, you knees are caving inwards when you are squatting the weight up. Keep them pointed out on the way down and up for optimal joint health and power transfer.  ";

This loosens up the muscles and allows for a more stable, proper squat. Also, when squatting down try and push you knees out, this is an important cue that can solve inward knee caving. Inward knee caving can also be caused by weak glutes, so if you have the extra time do a couple sets on the hip abductor machine or do some weighted hip thrusts."
